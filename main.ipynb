        "The objective of this project was to develop a data-driven solution that can predict the average salary for a given job posting using data from Glassdoor. This type of predictive tool is highly valuable for organizations seeking to benchmark compensation packages, ensure competitive salary offerings, and make informed hiring decisions based on market trends. Our approach combined data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling to address the business problem effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "We began by loading and inspecting the glassdoor_jobs_cleaned.csv dataset. The dataset contained various attributes including average salary (avg_salary), company rating (Rating), company age (company_age), job state, job title, and more. During the data wrangling phase, we focused on handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for analysis. Specifically, rows with missing avg_salary values were dropped as they directly impacted the target variable. Missing numerical values such as Rating and company_age were filled using mean and median imputation, respectively. Categorical variables like job_state were one-hot encoded to make them usable by machine learning algorithms. We also removed irrelevant columns such as text-heavy descriptions and unnecessary indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided insights into the distribution and relationships between variables. We used pair plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to visualize how features like company rating and age influence average salaries. For example, higher-rated companies generally offered slightly better salaries, though other factors also played significant roles. The EDA helped us understand potential multicollinearity issues and guided the feature selection process for the machine learning model.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the machine learning component, we applied a simple yet interpretable model — linear regression — as a baseline. We selected Rating, company_age, and other relevant numeric or encoded features as predictors. The dataset was split into training and test sets using an 80-20 split. The model was trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data. Performance was measured using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. The initial model produced reasonable predictions, with an R² score that indicated it captured key patterns in the data, though we recognize that more advanced algorithms like random forests or gradient boosting could further improve accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcome of this project is a functional salary prediction model that the client can integrate into their HR analytics processes. With this model, the client can estimate competitive salaries for different roles and locations based on historical data trends. This helps in designing offers that attract top talent while aligning with market standards. Additionally, the model can be updated over time with new job postings and salary data to maintain its relevance as market conditions change.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, our solution provides the client with a practical and interpretable machine learning tool to achieve their business objective of data-driven salary estimation. Beyond its immediate use in salary prediction, this project lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as incorporating additional features (e.g., skills, certifications, benefits offered) or adopting more complex models for better accuracy. By continuing to refine this model and integrate external market data, the client can stay ahead in a competitive hiring landscape and make compensation decisions with confidence.\n",

        "To help the client achieve their business objective of accurately estimating employee salaries based on company and job characteristics, we propose a data-driven machine learning solution. Using the cleaned Glassdoor dataset, we built a predictive model that leverages key features such as company rating, company age, job location, and job type to estimate average salaries. This model enables the client to gain deeper insights into salary trends across industries, regions, and job roles, supporting data-informed decisions on compensation strategies. By integrating this model into their workflow, the client can benchmark salaries against competitors, optimize their job offers, and improve talent acquisition by offering competitive packages that align with market standards. Additionally, this solution provides a foundation for continuous improvement — as more data becomes available, the model can be refined for even greater accuracy, ensuring the client stays ahead in a dynamic job market."

        "In this project, we successfully developed a machine learning solution that predicts average salaries based on key job and company features from the Glassdoor dataset. Through systematic data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and model training, we gained valuable insights into the factors that influence salaries — such as company rating and age. The final model provides the client with a reliable tool to estimate compensation levels, enabling more competitive and data-backed salary offers. This not only supports smarter recruitment strategies but also helps in aligning with industry standards. Moving forward, incorporating additional features (like skills, education requirements, or job descriptions) and regularly updating the model with new data will further enhance prediction accuracy and business value."
